# PREDICTING   CORROSION    RATE    OF   PIPELINE STEELS    IN     SUPERCRITICAL    CO2    ENVIRONMENTS   USING   SUPERVISED   MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS
Corrosion problem poses a significant economic and safety challenge globally, particularly affecting the petrochemical, marine engineering, and infrastructure sectors. Annually, the direct costs of corrosion exceed $2.5 trillion worldwide, approximately 3-4% of each nationâ€™s GDP, not accounting for substantial indirect expenses such as production shutdowns and environmental mitigation. Traditional methods for predicting corrosion rates, relying on simplified empirical formulas and experimental data, fall short in addressing the complex interdependencies of factors influencing corrosion. These factors include environmental conditions, material composition, and external stresses, which often lead to nonlinear corrosion behaviors poorly represented by conventional models.
This research leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict corrosion rates, employing a robust datasets encompassing chemical composition, operational conditions, and extensive physical measurements.  By comparing a diverse suite of ML and DL models, including Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Transformer Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks, this study demonstrates the superior accuracy and flexibility of data-driven approaches over traditional methods. The findings highlight the potential of these models in revolutionizing corrosion prediction with applications in real-time monitoring and proactive maintenance strategies. Additionally, this investigation emphasizes the importance of model interpretability, aiming to enhance transparency and operational utility, thereby increasing trust among industrial practitioners in these advanced predictive tools.
